## ALFRED development

This is the git page for the Advanced Label, Fitting, Recognition and Enhancement of Data (ALFRED) software. In here, the latest version will be available as soon as possible, with a better version control than the one implemented thus far. The needed documentation will be added along the way.

For any questions, please contact the team.
